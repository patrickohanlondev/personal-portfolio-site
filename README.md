# First draft of my personal portfolio site
This project was started at the beginning of my Javascript learning. However this site doesn't feature Javascript as I used this as an exercise to make sure that I had a good understanding of HTML and CSS before continuing.

## Purpose of this site

This site will act as a place to congregate the different Javascript projects I create in the near future.

### What did I learn on this project

Admittedly I assumed this project would be quite easy as I felt I had a firm grasp on HTML and CSS at this point. Unfortunately I ran into quite a few issues. Fortunately these became great learning opportunities. Firstly I tired to use CSS grid to great an overall layout of the site. This initially worked well. Being able to use properties such as 'grid-template-areas' to quickly and efficiently create a layout was game-changing. Eventually I went to add text or images to these grid areas only to find that the grid would change shape. A lot of searching and reading resources such as W3Schools, Stack Overflow and MDN Web Docs yielded no results.

To resolve this issue I moved to using a combination of flexboxes and position:absolute to create my desired layout. I'm glad I did this as working on the code now feels more modular and easier to manipulate at a later date.

In the near future I will make this page more responsive and mobile friendly.
